\chapter{Design}
A branch predictor modeled using the Alpha 21264 microprocessor tournament predictor is simulated in software in order to demonstrate the performance of this particular technique of branch prediction.
The predictor simply makes both a local prediction and a global prediction, and uses a choice prediction that predicts which of the two prediction techniques will be correct.
Once the branch is taken or not taken we update the prediction tables as well as the path history.
The local prediction table uses a 3-bit saturation counter that is initialized to the weakly taken state.
The global prediction table uses a 2-bit saturation counter that is initialized to the weakly not taken state.

\chapter{Testing}
This chapter describes validation of the tournament predictor. Initialization values of the saturation counters and path history are described as well as test methods.

\section{Testing Initialization}
Several initialization values for the saturation counters were considered, and the following is the resulting benchmarks for each initialization value:
Set saturation counters to the following values and get results of tests\\

\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular} { c c c c c c c }
    Global & Local & Choice & FP & INT & MM & Notes\\
    \hline
      0 & 0 & 0 & 4.816 & 12.407 & 9.795 & Strongly not taken/Strongly Local\\
      1 & 3 & 1 & 4.724 & 12.234 & 9.798 & Weakly not taken/Weakly Local\\
      \#2 & 4 & 0 & 4.433 & 11.253 & 9.094 & Weakly taken/Strongly Local\\
      2 & 4 & 1 & 4.430 & 11.265 & 9.093 & Weakly taken/Weakly Local\\
      2 & 4 & 2 & 4.431 & 11.279 & 9.093 & Weakly taken/Weakly Global\\
      2 & 4 & 3 & 4.434 & 11.269 & 9.098 & Weakly taken/Strongly Global\\
      3 & 7 & 3 & 4.547 & 12.512 & 9.141 & Strongly taken/Strongly Global\\
  \end{tabular}
\end{center}
\# represents chosen initialization

\section{Test functionality of each predictor}
\subsection{Local Prediction Table}
\begin{itemize}
  \item{Verify that LPT stays in predict taken state by giving it multiple branches that will test each direction of the counter of the taken side. Actual outcome of branches will be TTTTNNNTTT. Predicted outcome was <insert from spreadsheet>. Note: first branches tests that it goes to strongly taken; next three test to see that it goes back to weakly taken.}

  \item{Test that it switches from taken to not-taken by giving it multiple branches that
    are first taken then not taken and back again to check both directions. Actual outcome of branches will be NNTTTNNNN. Predicted outcome was <insert from spreadsheet>. Note multiple branches go to the same saturation counter. This is not really ideal but is necessary due to constraints.}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Global Prediction Table}
The path history must be preloaded to ensure it goes to the same sat counter each time.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item{Test that it stays not taken by giving it multiple branches that are all actually not taken.}

    \begin{itemize}
      \item{The pattern needed for preloading the path history to ensure use of the same counter will be to just use 0 every time it goes through}
      \item{Pattern for actual branch outcome will be NTNNTNNTNN. Predicted output was <insert from spreadsheet>.}
    \end{itemize}
  \item{Test that it switches from not-taken to taken by giving it multiple branches that are first not-taken and then taken.}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item{Pattern for preloading path history is the same as above. Predicted output was <insert from spreadsheet>.}
      \item{Pattern for actual branch outcome will be NTTTNNTNTT. Predicted output was <insert from spreadsheet>.}
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Choice Prediction Table}
The path history must be preloaded to ensure it goes to the same saturation counter each time.
\begin{enumerate}
  \item{Test that it stays local by giving it multiple branches that local would be correct in its prediction and then switch to global.}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item{Pattern for actual branch outcome is NNNNNNTTTTTT. Predicted output was <insert from spreadsheet>.}
    \end{itemize}
  \item{Test that it switches from local to global by giving it multiple branches that would cause it to switch back and forth between predictors}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item{Pattern for actual branch outcome is NNNNTT. Predicted output was <insert from spreadsheet>.}
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

Note: the first 4 are not taken so that it will put both L and G predictors to strongly not taken, but because it only takes two incorrect branches for the global predictor to switch to taken it is possible to get the global predictor to predict correctly before the local predictor.
